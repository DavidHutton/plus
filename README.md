Phosphorus Land Use and Slope (PLUS+) Model
PLUS+ is a GIS based system that provides the ability to investigate present day P concentrations in standing waters in Scotland through source apportionment techniques. The model has the potential to be used in investigating consents, sensitivity analysis and scenario analysis using changing land cover situations and point source P, storing input and output parameters in a centralized database.
The code is provided as a form to run in the VBA environment of Esri ArcMap.
